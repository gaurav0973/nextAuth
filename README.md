Learnings from this Authentication applicatio 
1. signup (frontend and backend logics)
2. login (frontend and backend logics)
3. logout (backend logic)

Now after that I havea problem which is
- I dont have a mechanism to protect my routes 
- when I am in my prifile page, then also i can go to login and signup page
- logged in user should not be seeing the login and signin page insted thoud see the other pages 

Solution  : middleware is the way
